I'm using Next.js to power this website. Originally I was using Gatsby and Strapi to host the CMS content. Next.js is a much nicer experience. 

It's currently a static site and I will keep it hosted on Github pages, but if some of the demo / portfolio pages I want to host need some backend then I'll have an excuse to try out Vercel.
